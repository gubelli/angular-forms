<h2>Welcome to the Angular Forms Workshop</h2>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>This repository consists of several branches. One for each exercise as well as one for each solution. You are
  currently on the <b>SOLUTION-5</b> branch. In order to progress, please open the corresponding exercise branch and
  implement your code there. Afterwards, you can verify your solution against the corresponding solution branch.</p>

<h3>Course slides</h3>
<p>The course slides to this workshop are commited on the gh-pages branch and can be found here:</p>

</ul>

<h3>Example form</h3>
<p>The Example form contains all elements which you learn during this workshop in one form:</p>
<ul>
  <li>FormGroup</li>
  <li>FormControl</li>
  <li>FormArray</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, it uses advanced Angular features like components with an attribute as a selector as well as @ContentChild
  and @HostBinding, which allow us to dynamically add and remove input errors more easily on the form. Those features
  are for simplicity reason not part of this workshop, as if you know those, likely also now how to write complex forms
  appropriately.</p>
