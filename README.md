# AngularForms

##Welcome to the Angular Forms Workshop
This repository contains several exercises, solutions, the workshop slides as well as a demo form.

By completing this workshop, you will understand what `FormControl`, `FormGroup` and `FormArray` are. Moreover, you will be able to apply them correctly. You will also learn how to handle typical problems like untouched field which shouldn't be marked invalid at first, but latest on submission.

This project consists of several branches, each having its own responsibilities:
* `master` (Contains instructions and an example form how smooth Angular Forms can be)
* `exercise-#` (Here, you can do the corresponding exercise)
* `solution-#` (Here, you can find the proposed solution to the corresponding exercise)
* `gh-pages` (Slides of the workshop)

This workshop assumes that you already have some Know-How in Angular and that you know how to use Angular CLI.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
(Please assure that webdriver-manager had been installed previously or run `npm install` in this directory to do so.)
